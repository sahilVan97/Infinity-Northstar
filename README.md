The project is based on [Project Northstar](https://developer.leapmotion.com/northstar)
The Open-source AR headset is centered around a [Leap Motion Controller](https://cms.ultraleap.com/app/uploads/2020/02/HERO-UltraLeap_Product05342_edit.jpg). The Leap Motion Controller is an optical hand tracking module that captures the movements of your hands with unparalleled accuracy. From XR to touchless kiosks, the Leap Motion Controller makes interaction with digital content natural and effortless.

The LeapMotion controller is paired with a [Intel T265/T261](https://www.intelrealsense.com/tracking-camera-t265/) 6-DOF position tracking module.
With its small form factor and low power consumption, the Intel® RealSense™ Tracking Camera T265 has been designed to give you the tracking performance you want straight off‑the‑shelf. Cross‑platform, developer friendly simultaneous localization and mapping for all your robotics, drone and augmented reality rapid prototyping needs.

We envision a future where the physical and virtual worlds blend together into a single magical experience. At the heart of this experience is hand tracking, which unlocks interactions uniquely suited to virtual and augmented reality.
To explore the boundaries of interactive design in AR, we created and open sourced Project North Star, which drove us to push beyond the limitations of existing systems.
